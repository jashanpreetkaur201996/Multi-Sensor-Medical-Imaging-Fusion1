# Multi-Sensor Medical Imaging Fusion Using Hybrid Filtering and Multi-Scale Adaptive Decomposition (HF-MSAD)

This repository provides the full implementation of the **HF-MSAD framework** for multi-modal medical image fusion using hybrid spatial filtering and multi-scale adaptive decomposition. The technique is validated on multi-sensor image pairs to enhance structure-preserving, contrast-enhanced fused images.

##  Overview

This repository provides the MATLAB implementation of the proposed Hybrid Filtering with Multi-Scale Adaptive Decomposition (HFâ€‘MSAD) framework for multi-sensor brain image fusion.
The method integrates bilateral filtering, guided filtering, and a multi-scale adaptive fusion strategy to produce high-quality fused brain images that preserve both structural edges and soft-tissue contrast.

HFâ€‘MSAD aims to address common limitations in existing fusion techniques, such as excessive blurring, edge loss, and artifact amplification, while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability.

## Requirements

MATLAB R2018a or later
Image Processing Toolbox
Pre-alligned brain image pairs (e.g., CTâ€“MRI, PETâ€“MRI, SPECTâ€“MRI) in .tif/.png format

##  Datasets Used

We used **six publicly available multi-sensor datasets** (CT,MRI,PET,SPECT) for validation.  All images are pre-alligned.

- Dataset 1: Pair of CT (non-contrast) + T1-weighted MRI
- Dataset 2: CT (non-contrast) + T2-weighted MRI
- Dataset 3: T1-weighted MRI + CT (bony structure)
- Dataset 4: Pair of T2-weighted MRI + T1-weighted MRI
- Dataset 5: Pair of T2-weighted MRI + PET (functional)
- Dataset 6: Pair of T2-weighted MRI + SPECT (functional)

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2018b (tested offline)
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, Windows/Linux system
